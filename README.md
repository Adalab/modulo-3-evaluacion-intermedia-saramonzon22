# Welcome to "Friends" phrase finder!

Hi! I'm Sara Monz√≥n and today I am going to make a phrase finder about the TV Show "Friends". This is part of the first evaluation of module 3 at Adalab. In this module we work with React to make a nice interactive web.
Check it!
To carry it out, first of all I have established the steps that I had to follow to develop it. I have created a file with the data provided, having the option later to obtain them through a fetch.
Later, I have made a function that allows "drawing" this data on the page to proceed to establish the search engines, both by words or phrases and by character.
At the end of it we have the option to save our own phrases, including which character said it!
Finally, I have given some styles to the page and you could even implement storing those phrases locally with local stogare.
